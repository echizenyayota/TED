### A. 0:16 - 0:37

When I was a kid, the disaster we were worried about most was a nuclear war.That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, and filled with the cans of food and water.When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, huker down and eat out of the barrel.
